Horrifying, right? But the supply of cocoa is endangered and chocolate is as bad as meat for our planet.\n\nWe make future-proof chocolate using precision fermentation. Doing this, our chocolate is 10x more sustainable and 20% cheaper than conventional chocolate. In order to mimic the organoleptic properties of chocolate (tender, smoothly melting taste release) we are working on the flavor itself but also on replacing the cocoa butter.\n\n55 Mio lbs of chocolate are consumed every day. By 2035 we will substitute a big chunk of it through our sustainable chocolate.", "numberOfEmployees": {"value": 42, "@type": "QuantitativeValue"}, "logo": {"contentUrl": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEqZ7dKwclrVw/company-logo_200_200/0/1658388098302/planetafoods_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=08-OqiaUhZfSExbhLOqE9qpZce9ZXgrlW_8qhuwyHH8", "description": "Planet A Foods", "@type": "ImageObject"}, "slogan": "Deliciously crafted, sustainable food for everyone - starting with 100% cocoa-free chocolate ", "sameAs": "www.planet-a-foods.com"}
