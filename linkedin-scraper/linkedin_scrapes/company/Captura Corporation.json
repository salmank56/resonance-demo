By studying the planet\u2019s natural cycles, Captura designed a solution that removes CO2 from the ocean and harnesses its ability to heal the climate\u2014a process known as Direct Ocean Capture.\n\nDeveloped and proven in Caltech\u2019s laboratories, our unique Direct Ocean Capture technology runs with just two ingredients: seawater and renewable electricity. It extracts CO2 directly from seawater to be permanently stored or reused. This amplifies the natural equilibrium between the ocean and atmosphere, drawing carbon out of the air and into the ocean to rebalance. \n\nCaptura\u2019s approach requires no rare-Earth minerals, adds nothing to the ocean, and leaves no chemicals behind. It\u2019s a low-cost, large-scale carbon removal solution that is environmentally sound.
