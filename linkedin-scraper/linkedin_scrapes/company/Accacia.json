Our platform automates the measurement of scope 1, 2, and 3 carbon emissions for operating assets, and embodied carbon for under-construction assets. \n\nA platform uniquely designed for real estate and infrastructure sectors, Accacia.ai allows companies to track emissions at the asset and portfolio levels with full consideration to organizational boundaries as defined by GHG Protocol. This allows accurate allocation of emissions for different stakeholders including asset owners, operators, and tenants. Along with asset-level emissions, our platform also helps asset managers track environment-related climate risks for their portfolios.\n\nWith Accacia:\n\n\ud83d\udcca Track data and report carbon emission levels in compliance with the GHG framework\n\n\ud83d\udce9 Get platform-integrated reporting; incl.
