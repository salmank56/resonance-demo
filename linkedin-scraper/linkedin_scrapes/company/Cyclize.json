This syngas serves as the basic building block of advanced chemicals and is used to produce plastics, methanol, hydrogen, and e-fuels. As of now, syngas is still obtained through the linear use of fossil resources such as natural gas. Our innovative plasma-based process allows us to replace fossil resources with waste materials, thus enabling the carbon circular economy and avoiding hundreds of megatons of CO2 annually by 2050.", "numberOfEmployees": {"value": 10, "@type": "QuantitativeValue"}, "logo": {"contentUrl": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFcfoE3e0uKgg/company-logo_200_200/0/1651846953220?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=L416kySvkzBlFZ3Pq4wys7-KFImo0-DjnuGpE9G5ivw", "description": "Cyclize", "@type": "ImageObject"}, "slogan": "Replacing fossil feedstock using plastic waste and CO2 to defossilize industry and enable a circular economy of carbon", "sameAs": "https://cyclize.de/"}
