We have developed proprietary geothermal technologies targeting lower surface temperatures (100 to 250\u00b0C) which, if successful, will reduce the cost of geothermal electricity production and enable \"geothermal everywhere\" across the U.S. and around the world. \n\nSage is unique in that we have a bias to action and moving quickly to field testing. We also recognize there are so many different parameters that impact the design of the well and power plant, so we have developed a geothermal modeling tool called GeoTwin and have tested it with real field data from the DOE and our own field tests. This modeling tool allows us to accurately estimate the amount of geothermal power that can be generated based on geological conditions, wellbore configurations, power plant efficiencies, etc. GeoTwin is unique to the industry and gives Sage a competitive advantage by reducing the need for capital spend by accurately predicting field results via modeling.", "numberOfEmployees": {"value": 10, "@type": "QuantitativeValue"}, "logo": {"contentUrl": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D0BAQFsOxOOeXVseA/company-logo_200_200/company-logo_200_200/0/1654568339647/sage_geosystems_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=VaS9i7kisyueLn8n2kE33McX2GDun2jN61MawTyJjXk", "description": "Sage Geosystems Inc.", "@type": "ImageObject"}, "slogan": "Geothermal everywhere.", "sameAs": "https://www.sagegeosystems.com"}
