The extraordinary abundance of these materials eliminates price volatility and supply chain insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegatons of Electrode Materials are Needed to Meet Global Demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSodium-ion batteries can be manufactured using the same equipment and infrastructure as lithium-ion batteries, but the engineered active materials they require are not yet produced at scale. That's where we come in.\nBedrock Materials designs, engineers, and manufactures sodium-ion cathode materials based on earth abundant metals. We specifically tailor our materials to meet the needs of underserved applications in mobility markets, such as low-voltage, starter-lighting-ignition, micromobility propulsion, and industrial traction.\nAs an North American supplier, we also help battery makers take advantage of tax credits such as those found in the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Sodium-Ion Today?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSodium-ion batteries deliver somewhat less energy density than lithium-ion, but recent advancements have finally made them competitive for entry-level markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVehicle Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s electric vehicles travel 35% further on the same energy as vehicles from 12 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Charging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging is three times faster and 10 times more ubiquitous than ten years ago, reducing range requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery Packaging\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern battery packs use space 50% more efficiently, improving pack-level energy density regardless of chemistry choice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Designed for the Mass Market\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSodium-ion batteries are a natural fit for segments of the market where cost, abundance, and safety are prioritized over premium performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent on critical minerals\n\nLithium\nCopper\nNickel\nCobalt\nPhosphorous\nGraphite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremium energy density (500 Wh/L+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew or no critical minerals\n\nIron\nManganese\nSodium\nAluminum\nCarbon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass market energy density (300 Wh/L+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom-up Disruption\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday's best sodium-ion batteries can nearly match the energy density of LFP.
