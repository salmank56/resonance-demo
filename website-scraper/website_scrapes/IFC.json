For over 60 years, we've transformed this belief into reality throughout the developing world.\nAs pioneers in impact investing, we fuel growth where it's needed most. Our strategic capital empowers visionary entrepreneurs to bring sustainable solutions to scale while our expertise builds successful business environments and creates opportunities for all.\nYet our impact extends beyond dollars and policy reforms. We plant seeds of human potential in the world's toughest soil. Our investments generate jobs, unlock innovation, and cultivate markets that lift millions out of poverty. We mobilize a global community of partners united by a shared purpose - to create opportunity where it's needed most.\nFor us, a job is more than a paycheck. It is dignity. It is hope for a better future. Opportunity by opportunity, we are building that future - one where inclusive, sustainable growth empowers all people to achieve their aspirations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore about what we do\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Our Leadership\r\n    \nIFC's Management Team shapes the organization’s strategies and policies with support from a diverse and dedicated staff.

Partnerships are essential for achieving these goals. IFC works with a wide range of partners that help create markets and mobilize private sector investment to address complex development challenges.\n\nPartnerships enable and amplify development impact\nIFC’s partnerships with governments, multilateral institutions, private philanthropies, and corporations enable solutions that IFC cannot deliver alone. Our partnerships harness external funding, expertise and influence to unlock constraints to private sector development. They amplify our impact by scaling up resources for new investments as well as through supporting upstream and advisory work, which are essential for creating investment opportunities. Our partners have contributed $2,056 million ($724 million for blended finance and $1,332 million for advisory) in support between FY 2018 to FY 2022, which have been vital for carrying out IFC’s mission. IFC also engages with key international institutions, including the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), other Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), as well as multilateral fora such as the G7 and the G20 to provide thought leadership and coordinate efforts to strengthen the role of the private sector in development.\nGrowing depth and breadth of our partnerships\nIFC is leveraging its thought leadership, convening power and global presence to establish and strengthen partnerships that address key development challenges. These include long-standing challenges such as climate change, food security, economic inclusion, forced displacements, among others. For example, IFC is partnering with the International Labor Organization (ILO) to develop innovative solutions to address labor standards in global value chains. In another example, IFC is partnering with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to create economic opportunities for refugees and their host communities in recognition of the nexus between humanitarian and development needs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Factsheets\r\n    \n\nIFC and Australia\nIFC and Canada\nIFC and Korea\n\nIFC and New Zealand\nIFC and South Africa\nIFC and United States\nIFC and Western European Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Related Links\r\n    \n\nIFC Annual Report 2023\nMobilization of Private Finance by MBDs and DFIs in 2022\nPerformance Assessment of IFC by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN)\nAmundi Planet Emerging Green One: Annual Impact Report 2023\nMultimedia Stories: Connected Communities\nBlended Concessional Finance\n2022 World Bank Trust Fund Annual Report\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Partners\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Governments\r\n    \nIFC partners with more than 25 governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Multilateral Institutions\r\n    \n\nMultilateral Development Banks\nG7 and G20\nWTO\nWHO\nUNHCR\nILO\nOECD\nMOPAN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Key Private Philanthropies we partner with\r\n    \n\nBHP Foundation\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation\nGlobal Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP)\nGoldman Sachs Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Past Partners\r\n    \n\nIKEA Foundation\nWells Fargo Foundation\nIceland\nThe Rockefeller Foundation\nMastercard Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases\nView more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStories\n\n\n\n\n\nMore stories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://webapi.worldbank.org/aemsite/ifc/search\n{\"search\": \"*\",\"filter\": \"(language eq 'English') and (((topics/any(topic: topic eq 'Partnership Development and Management'))) and (contentType eq 'Story' or contentType eq 'Interview' or contentType eq 'Audio'))\",\"count\": true,\"top\": 3,\"skip\": 0,\"orderby\": \"contentDate desc\"}\n3\nhorizontal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights & Reports\n\n\n\n\n\nView more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://webapi.worldbank.org/aemsite/ifc/search\n{\"search\": \"*\",\"filter\": \"(language eq 'English') and (((topics/any(topic: topic eq 'Partnership Development and Management'))) and (contentType eq 'Report' or contentType eq 'Market Analysis' or contentType eq 'Case Study' or contentType eq 'Article'))\",\"count\": true,\"top\": 6,\"skip\": 0,\"orderby\": \"contentDate desc\"}\n6\nvertical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIFC Partnerships\nTeam Inbox\nFor queries related to donors, multilateral organizations, philanthropies and foundations.\nPartnerwithus@ifc.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIBRD\nIDA\nIFC\nMIGA\nICSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nYoutube\nInstagram\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout IFC\nOur Impact\nCareers\n\n\nGlobal language toggler\nEnglish\n\n\n日本語\nFrançais\nعربي\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 IFC\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy\nScam Warning\nGeneral Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIBRD\nIDA\nIFC\nMIGA\nICSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout IFC\nOur Impact\nCareers\n\n\nGlobal language toggler\nEnglish\n\n\n日本語\nFrançais\nعربي\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nYoutube\nInstagram\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 IFC\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy\nScam Warning\nGeneral Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"https://www.ifc.org/en/about/diversity-equity-inclusion": "\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion | International Finance Corporation (IFC)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to Main Navigation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosures\nInsights & Reports\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho We Are\n\n\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nIFC is the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in developing countries.

It is foundational to our mission and underpins our success in engaging with our staff, clients, and stakeholders across the globe.\"\n― Makhtar Diop, Managing Director, IFC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe knowledge, skills, values, and diversity of our staff enable IFC to bring innovative solutions and global best practices to our clients. As part of the World Bank Group, IFC leads with the same core values of our parent organization – impact, integrity, respect, teamwork and innovation.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) are central to our commitment to employees and creating a culture where everyone is free to bring their whole selves to work. As the largest global development institution focused on the private sector in emerging markets and developing economies, IFC has a unique ability to shape best practices in this space.\nIFC’s DEI Commitments\nWe rely on the knowledge and skills of our employees, especially as we tackle inter-generational issues such as climate change and gender equality. However, not all staff experience the workplace in the same way, which can limit growth and creative potential. While we are tackling many facets of DEI, anti-racism and gender parity are core to this work. Our FY23 DEI Annual Report shares more.\n\nAs part of the WBG, IFC is committed to end racism. The WBG's Anti-Racism Charter was created in response to recommendations from the World Bank Group Anti-Racism Task Force, whose mandate is to provide concrete recommendations to the president and senior leadership on how to end racism and racial discrimination within the organization, its programs, and communities. The Task Force was set up in 2020 and IFC teams are working to help achieve this critical goal.\nIFC earned the second level of EDGE certification, EDGE MOVE, in 2022. Economic Dividends for Gender Equality (EDGE) is the leading global standard for gender equality in the workplace.\nIFC’s sponsorship and reverse mentorship programs are important pathways to building a pipeline of leaders with inclusive leadership capabilities. Our sponsorship program pairs talented staff with vice presidents to support career development. The reverse mentorship program positions young staff as mentors and senior management members as mentees. Both programs have had multiple successful cohorts and continue to operate.\nPeople-Focused and People-Led\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Related Links\r\n    \n\nFY23 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Annual Report\nFY22 DEI Annual Report\nFY21 Key DEI Highlights Report\nInvesting In Our People\nWorld Bank Group (WBG) Community Connections Program\nWBG Supplier Diversity Statement\nWBG Socially Responsible Procurement Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        IFC DEI Council\r\n    \nThe DEI Council advises the management team on meeting diversity goals and fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment. The membership of the DEI Council consists of Employee Resource Group members and DEI Advocates nominated to the role and who act as bridges between key stakeholder groups. The council is Co-Chaired by Elena Bourganskaia, Vice President of Corporate Support and Emmanuel Nyirinkindi, Vice President of Cross-Cutting Solutions.\nIn FY21, IFC also appointed its first ever dedicated Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) leader, Rani Pooran, to enhance efforts to define and implement a multi-year DEI strategy across the institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)\r\n    \nAn important part of our DEI work comes from employee-led groups that provide staff with safe spaces to connect, learn, and grow. IFC has four official groups open to any member of staff to join. \n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n        Inclusive Leadership\r\n    \nIFC employs over 4,000 people.

The arc of change has been steady. IFC is committed to continuing to find new and innovative ways to create a psychologically safe workplace, where employees can bring their whole selves to work every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRani Pooran\nProgram Lead, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nRPooran@ifc.org\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIBRD\nIDA\nIFC\nMIGA\nICSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nYoutube\nInstagram\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout IFC\nOur Impact\nCareers\n\n\nGlobal language toggler\nEnglish\n\n\n日本語\nFrançais\nعربي\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 IFC\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy\nScam Warning\nGeneral Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIBRD\nIDA\nIFC\nMIGA\nICSID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout IFC\nOur Impact\nCareers\n\n\nGlobal language toggler\nEnglish\n\n\n日本語\nFrançais\nعربي\nEnglish\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedin\nYoutube\nInstagram\nWhatsApp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 IFC\nUser Agreement\nPrivacy\nScam Warning\nGeneral Inquiry\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]}
