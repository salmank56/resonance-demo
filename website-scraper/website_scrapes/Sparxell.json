The core crystalline part of cellulose is extracted from these sources and dispersed into water randomly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 After prepping the cellulose crystals in water, they self assemble from a chaotic (isotropic) configuration into an ordered (cholesteric) state upon drying. Using our patented technology, the densely packed crystals now forms a film that reflects light and colour over a large area. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 By controlling the interactions between the crystals, the cellulose film can be tailor-made to match a specific appearance. The film can then be ground and shaped into a range of sizes and forms —voilà!
