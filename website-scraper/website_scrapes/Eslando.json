This strategy calls upon the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) to define DPP requirements. The ESPR is expected to be adopted in 2024, when specific DPP requirements will start to be written as Delegated Acts.The DPP should be easily accessible by scanning a data carrier, such as a QR code. The data carrier should be physically present on the product itself to ensure the information remains accessible throughout its life cycle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can Eslando Relabel help Brands? \n\n\n\nRelabel is a Digital Product Passport created by Eslando to empower brands to deliver on their sustainability mission.\nFor fashion brands, the DPP presents both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand, it will require them to collect and report more data about their products.

We believe that the only way to truly address the problem of apparel recycling is to work together with key stakeholders. This way we can create a more sustainable fashion industry that benefits everyone.Our vision is to enable a greater volume of clothing to be recycled, reducing waste, increasing the supply of recycled materials and easing the burden the fashion industry places on our precious planet.Our Relabel Digital Product Passport is an innovative breakthrough technology solution that will accelerate recycling in the fashion industry through digitisation. Connecting brands with recyclers and engaging environmentally conscious consumers worldwide. If you are a brand, recycler, or sorter who is committed to apparel recycling, we encourage you to join us.

This makes the fashion industry responsible for 10% of global emissions. \nAnnually, over 100 million tons of textiles end up in landfills and incinerators. While the industry continues to exploit our planet for more resources,  this wasteful practice contributes to climate change, water pollution and habitat destruction. \nWe can change this by creating a data rich system through digital product passports. We can empower sorters and recyclers to increase the amount of clothing they recycle, which can in return benefit brands with a new source of sustainable raw material. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough our efforts, we're committed to advance the UN Sustainable Development Goals \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nUNSDG 12: Responsible Consumption and ProductionUNSDG 13: Climate action \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like clothes, you could also... \n\n\n\nStay In The Loop \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n I have read and agree to the terms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n I have read and agree to the terms & conditions\n\n\n\n\nLeave this field empty if you're human: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCo-Funded by \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nHome\nRelabel\nDPP Legislation\nAbout Us\nBlog\n \n\nContact UsContact Us \n\n\n\nHome\nRelabel\nDPP Legislation\nAbout Us\nBlog\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccelerating Textile Recycling\n \n\n\n\nSubscribe\nContact\nAbout Us\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\n \n\n\n\n \n\nCopyright © 2024 Eslando Circular Fashion\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scroll to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use cookies on our website to see how you interact with it.
