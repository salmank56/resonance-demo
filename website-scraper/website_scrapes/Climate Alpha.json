AlphaGeo worked closely with the firm to pinpoint climate risk, attribute it by fund, and calculate its potential impact over time. In analyzing the financial impact of climate volatility on its portfolios, Oaktree was able to rank and compare its asset performance across existing – and future – investments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphaGeo is working together with Zurich Group Investment Management to optimize its Global Real Estate portfolio performance. Using AlphaGeo’s AI-powered analytics platform, the collaboration aims to enhance investment performance by identifying regions with higher growth prospects based on climate risk and social resilience, potentially leading to significant improvements in asset valuations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nBentallGreenOak \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphaGeo partnered with Bentall Green Oak (BGO), a leading real estate investment manager, to incorporate climate change considerations into its investment processes. AlphaGeo developed a location-based due diligence assessment and integrated a climate coefficient into BGO’s valuation model. This enabled BGO to understand the potential financial impact of climate change on their portfolio, mitigate risks through insurance coverage and adjusted investment horizons, and identify climate resilient investment opportunities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE DEVELOPER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith climate awareness rising among homebuyers, one of America’s largest home builders sought to map out resilient locations for future housing starts. But it lacked robust data correlating land price forecasts to climate stability. In order to widen the footprint of its land banking strategy and anticipate the next set of fast-growing residential locations, AlphaGeo was used to identify the variables that will most influence liveability and property values. We analyzed both climate models and socio-economic trends, and ranked the counties where land was currently undervalued relative to their potential for appreciation. Our client was able to act on these arbitrage opportunities, deploying capital into geographies of high forecasted demand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nAtlas Capital \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtlas Capital was mandated to build a systematic investment index comprising multiple asset classes including REITs. AlphaGeo integrated multiple data streams from institutional vendors and provided risk-adjusted valuation for more than 150,000 REIT properties under multiple climate scenarios. This analysis was delivered on a custom interactive dashboard that ranks and clusters REITs according to location, property type, and other metrics, with quarterly updates based on the latest market data, allowing for algorithmic management of the Atlas Sustainable REIT Index. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the Atlas Capital case study\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapitaLand’s US investment team sought a comparative analysis of multiple high-growth cities for the industrial sector based on climate risk. CapitaLand commissioned AlphaGeo to produce a detailed study of scenarios for property valuations for a major commercial hub highlighting growth prospects for the industrial sector based on multiple climate, economic, and demographic trajectories. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCLIMATE ANALYTICS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManifest Climate, a leading climate intelligence software, sought a solution to support its global industrial sector clients deploying data centers and other assets worldwide. It turned to AlphaGeo to provide detailed data and reports via its platform covering a range of indicators — both climate risk and location resilience — on their existing portfolios of assets as well as their pipeline of potential investment locations. The AlphaGeo data complemented the insights provided by Manifest Climate to successfully deliver a more comprehensive solution for its clients. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nSeaBridge Sustainability \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESG CONSULTING\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing number of SeaBridge clients sought climate physical and transition risk analytics in order to comply with increasingly stringent regulations in various US states. Working with AlphaGeo, SeaBridge managed unique accounts for its clients spanning real estate and infrastructure, delivering them regular data updates on their portfolios and introducing them to AlphaGeo’s portfolio construction tools as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTECH AND DATA PROVIDER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStateBook is the premiere provider of comprehensive economic market data for every community in the U.S. When the Statebook team sought to add a climate impact scorecard to its location intelligence service to guide economic development organizations (EDO) and commercial clients, AlphaGeo was implemented to provide local governments and prospective investors risk and resilience indicators as a roadmap for adaptation investments. The integration included licensing AlphaGeo’s proprietary Resilience Index to Statebook’s API feed to display AlphaGeo’s risk, vulnerability and readiness scores across all 3,000 U.S. counties. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBreevast took strong positions in distressed commercial properties in prime US cities after the 2008 financial crisis and sought to reassess its intended hold period in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Breevast shared pertinent financial data related to the acquisition price and operational information such as occupancy and yield. AlphaGeo used these data points to refine the development of multiple valuation scenarios for each asset for Breevast’s investment committee to consider. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACRE, a real estate investment company, collaborated with AlphaGeo to generate climate-driven valuations for a specific subset of its multi-family property funds. ACRE’s ESG investment team shared location data for key multi-family properties across the United States, and AlphaGeo utilized this data to provide Climate Price™ forecasts and Resilience Index™ scores. These forecasts and scores enabled ACRE to incorporate climate considerations into their valuation process, allowing them to assess the potential impact of climate change on their multi-family properties and make informed investment decisions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaseline Property Group was undertaking a strategic expansion to build thousands of new holiday homes in fast-growing markets. AlphaGeo collected, assessed and layered a wide range of datasets related to holiday home rentals, building permitting, construction activity, recreational infrastructure, migration, economic activity, and the Resilience Index to identify locations best suited to Baseline’s mandate, as well as designed a sophisticated presentation for the firm’s management to share with its key external partners. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAL ESTATE INVESTOR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReza Companies is a national retail investment advisory firm with a large footprint of retail and residential assets in key southwestern US cities sought a detailed market outlook for property values in light of growing climate change related risks. AlphaGeo conducted a granular assessment of climate scenarios for a range of adjacent zip codes in key metros areas and generated bespoke valuation forecasts for each of the client’s key 20 property locations. \n\n\n\n\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Development \n\n\n\nAlphaGeo guides developers through climate volatility towards the most desirable locations for sustainable living. As climate volatility accelerates, our models identify locations that offer the greatest divergence between current and future valuations, generating arbitrage opportunities for land banking, residential as well as mixed-use developments and master plans. \n\n\n\nFor decades, the most stable dataset in any country has been the price of an acre of land. But due to climate change, COVID, interest rates, insurance premiums, demographics, industrial policy, and regulations, there is now enormous volatility in what was once predictable. Which places will win as America’s population relocates in search of affordability, jobs and climate resilience? AlphaGeo identifies the anti-fragile locations that will appreciate amidst climate volatility. \n\n\n\n\nIdentify arbitrage opportunities in climate-resilient locations through predictive modeling of land values \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nTarget fast-growing cities for investment according to demographic shifts, infrastructure investment, quality of life metrics and more \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInvest early in the next boomtowns based on migration patterns and our proprietary datasets \n\n\n\n\nAlphaGeo is the first geospatial and Al-powered software that models hundreds of variables – from flood and fire to infrastructure investment and population shifts – to pinpoint the most promising locations for land banking and real estate development. Our predictive models rank every location in the country according to statistically significant indicators and forecast the future performance of land and real estate assets. No other toolkit gives clients the conviction to invest in the world’s most precious asset: resilient geography. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand value appreciationscenarios: baseline vs rapidwarming \n\n\n\n\n\n10-year appreciation underbaseline scenario \n\n\n\n\n\n10-year appreciation underRCP 8.5 scenario \n\n\n\n\n\nTop 20 zip codes with stronghistorical growth \n\n\n\n\n\n48.5% (4.03% р.а.) \n\n\n\n\n\n19.3% (1.78% p.a.) \n\n\n\n\n\nTop 20 zip codes withclimate resilience \n\n\n\n\n\n42.3% (3.59% р.а.) \n\n\n\n\n\n60.9% (4.87% p.a.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how it works: \n\n\n\nUsers select from criteria in our Alpha Finder screening tool – variables such as income, unemployment rate, credit scores, tax rates, in-migration, infrastructure quality, groundwater availability, flood risk, greenfield corporate investment, life expectancy, crime rates and dozens more – and we generate a customized ranking and map of counties, zip codes and census tracks that best meet that mandate. You can even weight the criteria and input your own in-house datasets to enhance the results. We continuously update the data from public and private sources and add more features for you to choose from. \n\n\n\n\nThe AlphaGeo platform provides a rigorous underpinning for land banking, programmatic joint ventures, and other strategies oriented around absolute returns as well as income generation. Land acquired in a closed or rolling fund can be sold in intervals (e.g. 2-3 years, 4-5 years, 5-7 years, etc.) to real estate operating companies for master-planned developments, and energy and water utilities. The search for “climate havens” is triggering what will be a decades-long relocation of America’s demographic, infrastructural, and economic footprint. AlphaGeo guides you into a more resilient future. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nHomebuyers \n\n\n\nThe long-term nature of infrastructure spending and management requires complex forecasting capabilities around economic demand, demographic shifts and climate risk:Incorporate location risk and resilience profiles into asset maintenance planningForecast climate impact tipping points on locations to avoid stranded assetsIdentify optimal locations for new investments in mobility and energy infrastructures  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial & Insurance \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInsurance and reinsurance \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tLenders \t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance and Reinsurance \n\n\n\nIncorporate climate data into underwriting, calibrating premiums to match risk.Climate risk models capture only first-order impact, not the effects of climate change in real-world contexts.

The tracking index shown here includes a one-month forward projection. This is not calculated using rolling averages, but rather by incorporating a feature selection algorithm. We will soon extend the forward view to include one, two and three-month forward projections.​ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify favorable locations and sectors amidst America’s industrial renaissance \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the IRT white paper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeoSense Newsletter \n\n\n\nGeoSense is your compass for finding alpha.
