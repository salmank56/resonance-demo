Drastic steps are needed to reduce the harm that increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have on our planet.Clairity’s Direct Air Capture technology will clean the air we breathe and help to keep the planet habitable for generations to come.Decarbonizat­ion is the single most important step we can take to reduce the harm of climate changeDecarbonization involves the important goals of decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels and increasing our reliance on alternative energy sources such as solar, geothermal, and nuclear.Clairity’s Direct Air Capture system will support concurrent decarbonization efforts by removing billions of tons of CO2 that, without remediation, will continue to impact our planet for centuries to come.The need is so great that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that between 10 to 20 gigatons of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be required annually by 2050, with increased removal capacity by 2100, to limit warming to 2°C.Clairity:Gigaton Solutions forGigaton ProblemsLearn MoreClairityREVERSING CLIMATE CHANGEClairityREVERSING CLIMATE CHANGERemove CO2 with ClairityLet’s connect© 2024 Clairity Technology Inc.Los Angeles, CA"}]}
