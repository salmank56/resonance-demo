An explosion of satellite and computing technology will soon allow us to see what’s happening on the ground and on the water, everywhere, in near real-time.\nIn the past, SkyTruth analysts examined imagery manually to recognize patterns and environmental impacts on the ground and in the water. Today, with new technology, we are teaching computers to scan the thousands of images available every day to automatically detect those changes around the globe. With these advancements, we can analyze far more images every day, and it is becoming possible to take action to minimize or even stop environmental damage before it occurs.\n\nImage from ESA/ATG medialab.\n\n\nExposing environmental harm\nAs we move forward, we will apply these cutting edge techniques to more and more of our work, enabling us to cover larger areas of the Earth and making it harder than ever for polluters, poachers, and industry to get away with harming the planet.

In that moment, he realized that satellite imagery could expose harmful human activities that were otherwise hidden from view.\nBack then, few conservation groups, concerned citizens, journalists, or policymakers had the expertise or resources to access and analyze the information that was available from space. In starting SkyTruth, John leveled the playing field and gave away information that previously was available only to industry.\n\n\nThe SkyTruth epiphany\nExamining a satellite image of the devastation surrounding the eruption of Mount St. Helens years earlier, John noticed extensive forest clearcutting nearby.

In starting SkyTruth, John leveled the playing field and gave away information that previously was available only to industry.\n\n\n\nSkyTruth has always led by example, using Google’s cloud computing platforms to develop solutions for conservation issues with global implications. Their expertise spans beyond just the technology to work with other organizations and motivated citizens to produce compelling visualizations, making the world aware, and driving positive change.\nBrian SullivanProgram Manager, Google Ocean & Earth Outreach\n\n\nA pivotal moment\nApril 2010 was a pivotal moment in SkyTruth’s history, and the history of the Gulf of Mexico. An offshore drilling rig called the Deepwater Horizon exploded in the Gulf, killing 11 men and setting in motion the largest accidental oil spill in history.\nSkyTruth was the first to publicly challenge BP’s inaccurate reports of the fate of oil spilling into the Gulf. With our partners at Florida State University, we used satellite images to estimate the actual amount of oil gushing from the damaged well. Based only on the oil that appeared on the surface, we calculated the rate of flow from the well was twenty-five times more than BP was reporting.\n\n\nSkyTruth in the spotlight\nChallenging BP’s estimates brought significant media attention to our mission and demonstrated the role that remote sensing has to play in understanding environmental issues.\nOur long-term goal is not just to report on disasters, but to inspire a global movement where everyone can easily access the resources we use, and be motivated to protect the planet from future catastrophes.\n\n\nSkyTruth in the spotlight\nChallenging BP’s estimates brought significant media attention to our mission and demonstrated the role that remote sensing has to play in understanding environmental issues.\nOur long-term goal is not just to report on disasters, but to inspire a global movement where everyone can easily access the resources we use, and be motivated to protect the planet from future catastrophes.\n\n\nThe future of SkyTruth\nAs more and more satellites fill Earth’s orbit, the vast quantities of data available require a trusted source to sort through the thousands of images every day and spot damaging activities – sometimes while they are occurring.\nSkyTruth is that trusted source. We develop and use the latest technology, such as machine learning, to analyze, interpret, and – most importantly – publish maps, images, and other information in a way that allows the public to hold polluters and others accountable for their actions.\n\n\nLooking for ways to support SkyTruth?\nConsider donating to help us continue our work and explore other ways to get involved.\n\nDonateGet Involved\n\nLooking for ways to support SkyTruth?\nConsider donating to help us continue our work and explore other ways to get involved.\n\nDonateGet Involved\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
