Biomass (organic residues) is heated at high temperatures and in the absence of oxygen. This is called pyrolysis. In this conversion process, the organic compounds of the biomass are thermo-chemically split and all volatile components pass into the gas phase. What remains is carbon in a solid, easily storable form: biochar. This process can yield various products, including biochar and renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does Biochar Carbon Removal capture and store CO₂?\nExpand\n\n\n\nThe basis is the carbon contained in plant residues. In the natural carbon cycle, this would be released back into the atmosphere as CO₂ via decay of the biomass or, for example, through forest fires. Through pyrolysis, biogenic residues are carbonized to biochar. In this process, biomass is converted into carbon under pressure and at high temperatures with the greatest possible removal of oxygen. This process prevents a large proportion of the CO₂ bound in the biomass via photosynthesis from escaping into the atmosphere. Depending on the carbon content and further use, one tonne of biochar binds around 2.5-2.8 tons of CO₂. The biochar is produced in a combustion-free process. If it is then used as a soil conditioner in agriculture or as a filler in building materials, the CO₂ ends up in a permanent carbon sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and why is it indispensable to limit global warming?\nExpand\n\n\n\nCarbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) involves methods for removing CO2 from the atmosphere and then storing it permanently. Climate neutrality cannot be achieved without CO2 removal, because in all scientific scenarios residual emissions will remain even with very ambitious reduction measures.\nThe climate target of the Paris Agreement is to limit man-made global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, the main aim is to drastically reduce greenhouse gases released. However, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a radical reduction in CO₂ emissions alone is no longer sufficient to achieve this goal. To stay on the 1.5-degree path, we would have to achieve NetZero emissions worldwide by 2050 at the latest. This NetZero will be possible with approximately 10-15 gigatons of CO₂ removal per year. Rapid scaling of CDR technologies is therefore essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are Carbon Removal Certificates created and calculated?\nExpand\n\n\n\nAs a Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) company, we process biomass through pyrolysis into biochar, thereby binding and storing the carbon present in the biomass. As soon as the biochar is demonstrably added to a permanent carbon sink (e.g. in agricultural soil or concrete), a certificate can be generated for the amount of carbon safely extracted. This is done on the basis of Puro.earth’s scientific method and a sound auditing process by independent third parties. Afterwards, the amount of CO₂ captured in the process can be traded as a Carbon Removal Certificate. This trading takes place on voluntary carbon markets and marketplaces like the NASDAQ platform Puro.earth, among others.\nAccording to the external method used, the certificate translates the carbon content of each production batch of biochar into CO₂ equivalents. The carbon content is measured on the basis of laboratory analysis. Then, all process, post-process and transport emissions are subtracted from this amount. Furthermore, depending on the use of the biochar, a possible degradation rate of the organic carbon components of the biochar in the soil is deducted as a safety buffer. The certificate calculates this degradation over at least 100 years and deducts a further general safety buffer. As a result, one ton of biochar is equivalent to approximately 2.5 – 2.8 tons of CO₂. Carbon Removal Certificates are an important financial tool for innovative CDR technologies like BCR, enabling rapid scaling to help achieve global climate goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind all frequently asked questions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovocarbo GmbH\nHermannstraße 40\n20095 Hamburg\nT. +49 40 740 770 60\nE. info@novocarbo.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Removal\nProjects\nGreen Heat\nNewsroom\nAbout us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs\nContact\nFAQ\nVisits\nPress Kit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegal Notice | Privacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Removal\n\nProjects\n\nGreen Heat\n\nNewsroom\n\nAbout Us\n\nJobs\n\nContact\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Removal\n\nProjects\n\nGreen Heat\n\nNewsroom\n\nAbout Us\n\nJobs\n\nContact\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Scroll to Top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"}, {"https://www.novocarbo.com/projects/": "  \n        Projects | Novocarbo                                      Skip to content                    Carbon Removal  Projects  Green Heat  Newsroom  About Us  Jobs  Contact                           Main Menu                           Our Projects                         RhineThe beginning âCarbon Removal Site Rhine2018 2The beginning âCarbon Removal Site Rhine2018 saw the construction of our first carbon removal plant with three BCR systems and a capacity of around 1000 t/a carbon credits.

Expand    A pyrolysis plant, such as the PX1500 from PYREG, is designed for the controlled carbonization of biogenic residues into biochar. In this process, biomass is first degassed and then converted into carbon under pressure and temperatures of 500 Â°C-750 Â°C with the greatest possible deprivation of oxygen. This process prevents a large proportion of the captured COâ from escaping into the atmosphere. One metric ton of biochar sequesters around 2.5-2.8 metric tons of COâeq, depending on the carbon content and further use. Our pyrolysis process essentially produces two products, which can then be stored in different ways: a solid form of carbon, namely biochar, that, for example, serves as a soil conditioner and forms a permanent carbon sink. The second product is process heat (pyrogases), which is a regenerative energy source for further heat utilization.          What is biochar? Expand    Biochar is produced by thermal carbonization (pyrolysis) of biomass such as waste wood, hedge trimmings as well as other biogenic residues e.g. from the food industry. Due to its porous structure and high internal surface area, biochar can store water or nutrients and be used as a filter material. These properties make it a true all-rounder that can play an important role in agriculture, industry and construction, for example.         What makes biochar a soil improver? Expand    Biochar supports the additional build-up of humus in the soil and prevents the leaching of phosphorus and nitrate. It also reduces nitrous oxide emissions on agricultural land and minimizes the need for irrigation. In addition, the resistance of plants to fungal diseases is increased. As an additive in the earth industry, biochar can replace peat and thus contribute to the preservation of peatlands, whose degradation in peat extraction causes methane emissions, a greenhouse gas that is around 28 times more harmful to the climate than COâ.         What can biochar be used for? Expand    Novocarbo’s biochar is mainly used as a soil conditioner, peat substitute in the earth industry, or in stormwater management for blue-green infrastructure projects. In addition, biochar replaces fossil or high emission resources in industry. Examples here include molded parts, housings and functional parts made of plastic, floor coverings or use as concrete aggregate. Novocarbo’s goal is to accelerate the active decarbonization of the industry with its economically viable products.
