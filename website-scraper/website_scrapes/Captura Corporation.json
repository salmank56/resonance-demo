It operates in equilibrium with the atmosphere, drawing carbon out of the air to maintain a natural balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ocean absorbs nearly one-third of our carbon emissions — but at great cost to itself. Captura has designed a solution to enhance this natural cycle while safeguarding the ocean’s health: removing excess CO2 from the upper ocean, so it can absorb more carbon from the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Direct Ocean Capture system runs with just two ingredients: seawater and renewable electricity. Using Captura’s proprietary membrane and electrodialysis technology, it extracts CO2 directly from seawater to be permanently stored or reused. Once the carbon is removed, the ocean naturally draws down CO2 from the atmosphere to rebalance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    How our Direct \nOcean Capture \nsystem works  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n    Simple, streamlined and scalable  \n\n\n\nSo simple, it scales\nTo remove carbon at gigaton scale, we need to do so in a seamless way. Requiring no rare-Earth minerals and leaving no by-products behind, our streamlined process is designed for scale.\n\n\n\nEngineered for efficiency\nWith only seawater and renewable electricity as inputs, and enabled by our ultra-efficient proprietary membranes, Captura systems are elegantly simple and highly effective.\n\n\n\nLowering the cost for all\nThe ocean is the greatest carbon removal mechanism on the planet, and amplifying its natural power allows for big impact at low cost.\n\n\n\nA measurable impact\nCaptura systems capture a verifiable stream of CO2 to be permanently stored or reused.

Captura’s system boosts natural cycles, while putting ocean health first. Our process requires zero additives, adds nothing to the ocean, and leaves no chemicals behind.\nOur dedicated oceanography team continuously monitors our interaction with marine ecosystems to optimize our process to make a lasting, positive impact.\n\nLearn more\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress\n\n\n\n\n        The first wave of climate solutions      \n\n\n\n\n    From inception in the labs of Caltech to a rigorous technology piloting program, Captura is scaling up Direct Ocean Capture to bring tangible benefits to our planet.  \nWith three pilot systems of increasing capacity, our team is rapidly levelling up our technology to be market ready. Following this pilot program, Captura will move into large-scale commercial deployments with individual plants that range from tens of thousands to millions of tons of CO2 removed annually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              1t/yr            \nOur first pilot system operated at Caltech’s Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory in Newport Beach, CA.\n2022\n\n\n\n\n\n              100t/yr            \nOur second-generation system was installed at marine research facility AltaSea at the Port of L.A.\n2023\n\n\n\n\n\n              1000t/yr            \nOur final pilot system will be deployed on the west coast of Norway in partnership with Equinor\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBring new life to existing structures\nOur early commercial plan includes scalable deployments that leverage existing ocean infrastructure, such as desalination plants or utilities that use seawater for cooling. We can also co-locate our systems with retired oil & gas rigs, effectively repurposing fossil fuel infrastructure into next-generation carbon removal facilities. Longer term, we envision megaton-scale standalone Captura platforms powered by offshore renewable energy to address carbon emissions across the globe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartner with us\n\n\n    Power the path \nto net zero  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild \nplants\nLicense our technology to build and operate plants around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSequester or utilize CO2\nPartner with us to permanently store or reuse the CO2 we capture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvest in a clean future\nCarbon removal is prime for investment—join us on our climate mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply \nequipment\nDeliver equipment critical to building the clean infrastructure our planet needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGet in touch \nwith our team.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nContact Us \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcaptura corp.\n2585 Nina Street\nPasadena, CA 91107\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nTechnology\nSolutions\nAbout\nInsights\nPrivacy Policy\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyoutube\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tx\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlinkedin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tStay informed on  Captura.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnter your details below to receive email updates on Captura news and developments.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nFirst name Last name Email*\n\n\n Subscribe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nΔ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"https://capturacorp.com/solutions/": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions - Captura\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tSkip to content\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tCaptura\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimary Menu\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTechnology\nSolutions\nAbout\nInsights\nReach Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nReach Out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA vast sea of potential\n\nThe negative emissions movement has just begun. More than 9,000 companies and 150 nations have committed to net zero — and that’s just the start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptura technology delivers a variety of climate solutions to help organizations meet critical targets. As we work with partners and customers to remove and reuse excess CO2 from the environment, our technology can make a profound impact on the climate challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon Dioxide Removal\n\n\n\n\n        Remove carbon. Heal the climate.      \n\n\n\nFighting climate change isn’t only about what we do for tomorrow — it’s how we clean up our past. To secure a habitable future for generations to come, we need to both reduce emissions and remove gigatons of existing CO2 from the atmosphere.\nThrough Direct Ocean Capture, we remove CO2 from the upper ocean, enhancing the ocean’s capacity to draw more carbon from the air. Once captured, the CO2 is safely and securely stored, via solutions like geologic sequestration, so it can no longer contribute to climate change.\nReducing emissions and removing carbon go hand-in-hand. Carbon removal is a critical piece of the net zero toolkit, providing a solution to address unavoidable emissions. It also offers a way to remove emissions from the past, so we can heal the climate for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSustainable Fuel and Products\n\n\n\n\n        Reuse carbon \nfor good.      \n\n\n\nOnce excess carbon is removed from the ocean, it can be put toward a number of sustainable uses. In addition to storage, captured CO2 can be turned into sustainable fuel to power existing vehicles. For hard-to-decarbonize transport sectors such as aviation and shipping, this provides a drop-in ready alternative to fossil fuels, with a high energy density and low carbon footprint. Alternatively, CO2 can be turned into a range of low-carbon products such as plastics, chemicals and building materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcean Acidification Mitigation\n\n\n\n\n        Clean ocean. \nClean future.      \n\n\n\nCaptura’s technology releases seawater that is CO2 depleted and slightly less acidic. If deployed in semi-enclosed parts of the ocean, such as bays, the process has the potential to counteract ocean acidification locally. This could have positive implications for vulnerable parts of the ocean or ocean-dependent communities, such as seafood farmers. Captura is working with third-party experts to evaluate this potential co-benefit of Direct Ocean Capture and will publish our findings via our Ocean Health and MRV Protocol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Applications\n\n\n\n\n        Innovating \nacross industries      \n\n\n\nCaptura’s Direct Ocean Capture technology involves processes and equipment with applications across a range of other sectors. Our proprietary membranes and membrane stacks deliver significant cost and efficiency advantages for industries that use electrodialysis and gas separation technologies, such as desalination and water treatment, electrochemical industries and Direct Air Capture.
