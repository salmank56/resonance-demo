These systems are capable of separating batteries by specific chemistry with greater accuracy, higher speeds, and lower cost than traditional methods.Direct Li-ion Battery RecyclingOur innovative direct recycling process isolates the various components from spent lithium-ion batteries and regenerates them into commercial-grade battery materials for reuse. This novel recycling method is more cost effective and sustainable than others.Learn moreLearn MoreCreating a truly circular economyOur technology solutions focus on finding greater efficiencies in the current battery recycling supply chain. We are able to drive meaningful cost savings while also ushering in a new era of environmental sustainability. A tech-first, automated approach to battery recyclingWe embrace the newest technologies to automate traditionally manual processes, resulting in lower costs, greater accuracy, and increased predictability over the supply chain.Our mission is to make recycling available to all.We believe in a world where efficient recycling processes aren't a nice-to-have but are rather the standard.Talk to usInterested in partnering?Â Get in touch.First name:Last name:Company Name: Title: Email:Message:Thank you!
