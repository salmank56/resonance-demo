And we’re not just talking about electricity, gas, water, air and steam. From employee productivity to raw material usage, energy is one of the most critical and costly resources that touches every aspect of an industrial facility. While Energy Management Systems have been around for years, it’s more important than ever not just to manage energy, but to optimize energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy challenges\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh costs\nFrom grid electrical power to gas and water, energy costs are among the top two costs for many industrial businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nLegacy technology\nDue to high costs and long upgrade cycles, it's very common for factories to have older, legacy equipment where data extraction is more difficult and time-consuming.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbon initiatives\nPressure is mounting for industrial businesses to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, leverage renewable energy, and reduce their carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy intensity\nThe first step into an energy-optimized future is to fully understand current energy usage – across lines and facilities. Traditional energy monitoring systems can provide part of the picture, but struggle to provide the breadth and depth of data needed to get a true understanding of all the energy being used in a business. What is needed is a system robust enough to gather data points from all your equipment – regardless of age and connectivity. This system must also normalize data types and sets to allow a consistent view across disparate facilities. Now you have a solid foundation for change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmarter, real-time energy intelligence\nTraditional Energy Management Systems can track building systems and weather performance. But without connecting those findings to production processes and data, no real-time adjustments or impacts can be made. Existing systems are built on passive data collection and reporting — long after any real-time changes can be made that would impact the bottom line.\nTo truly drive energy efficiencies, decisions need to be made immediately with real-time data. By using model predictive control systems that automate the optimization, industrial operations can respond to changes as they happen. Imagine being able to change an order when raw material prices rise, alter energy usage during rate spikes, or convert to lower-power usage during weather events.\n\n\nEnergy Intelligence Download\n\n\n\n\n“Without a benchmark like this [a carbon tax and dividend, for example], businesses and economies won’t be able to properly factor the cost of carbon and the benefit of alternatives into their long-term strategic planning and capital investment decisions.”\n-Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow we optimize energy\nFrom cold storage to biofuels, from automotive to retail, we’ve worked with a variety of industrial models and have seen first-hand the unique challenges they face. This experience has enabled us to build systems that can extract the essential data from myriad systems -– many of which were not designed to do so.\nTo deliver our energy intelligence solutions, we build a data foundation that enables insights and results, no matter what product or service you’re delivering. This means we can apply our knowledge and understanding to help you make impactful decisions to improve production costs, build efficiencies, and enhance your bottom line.\n\n\nBenefits & Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimize your energy usage\n\nSchedule a Demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNdustrial has helped companies avoid over $100 million in energy spend by driving down energy intensity, decreasing costs, and increasing sustainable industrial operations.\n\n\n\nApproach\n\nEnergy Intensity\nProduction First\nLoad Control\nIndustrial Data\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nProducts & Services\nOur Successes\nBenefits & Value\nCore Technologies\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nNews & Blog\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\n\n\n\nConnect\n\nDemo\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n+1.919.864.2264\n\n\n\nJoin our Mailing List\n\nSign Up Here\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ndustrial  ·  Privacy  ·  Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        [contact-form-7 id=\"2147\" title=\"Modal Download\"]      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        [contact-form-7 id=\"2296\" title=\"Modal Download\"]      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.

Broad industrial optimization means real-time data can be immediately analyzed for instant decision-making and quick alterations in the manufacturing process. It improves the usefulness of artificial intelligence and machine learning to guide performance optimization. Automation as we know it significantly evolves across facilities. And critical, decision-making analytics will be available at our fingertips on mobile devices.\nThe good news is that in this case, you really can have your cake and eat it too. The same data infrastructure put in place to optimize energy usage can be easily extended, without significant additional cost, to enable scalable, industrial optimizations across your business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization for you\n\n\n\n\n\nCEOs & Executives\nBusiness leaders are well aware that companies need to continually innovate and optimize their business to improve the bottom line. And that’s just what we help them achieve. We can help leaders make more strategic decisions and innovate effectively, which has a direct impact on profitability and market share.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacility Managers\nIn addition to the day-to-day oversight of production, facility managers also seek ways to improve efficiencies, enhance processes and productivity, and reduce costs. We can help them make sense of the overwhelming amount of disparate data, providing the information and analytics they need to make more educated, strategic decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nData Scientists\nData scientists are tasked with creating and implementing the systems that enable the deep, integrated analysis of production data. However, creating a platform to integrate, normalize and transform disparate data has proved challenging and expensive. We deliver custom and off-the-shelf solutions they can build upon as their business grows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustrial operations optimized\n\n\n\n\n\nProductivity\nAssess both internal and external production-related factors to improve productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisibility\nGain instant data analysis for greater visibility into every facet of production.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality and Asset Management\nEvaluate performance and make informed decisions about raw material vendors, production processes, and products.\n\n\n\n\n\nInventory Management\nTrack and manage inventory and quickly react to changing needs for improved cash flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransport Logistics\nImprove delivery processes and times through more efficient planning and scheduling.\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomation\nOptimize processes and production costs through automated devices, Internet of Things (IoT) technology, sophisticated sensors, artificial intelligence, cloud-enabled business models, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive Maintenance\nReduce downtime by implementing required maintenance more strategically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild your energy foundation\n\nSchedule a Demo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNdustrial has helped companies avoid over $100 million in energy spend by driving down energy intensity, decreasing costs, and increasing sustainable industrial operations.\n\n\n\nApproach\n\nEnergy Intensity\nProduction First\nLoad Control\nIndustrial Data\n\n\n\nSolutions\n\nProducts & Services\nOur Successes\nBenefits & Value\nCore Technologies\n\n\n\nCompany\n\nNews & Blog\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nCareers\n\n\n\nConnect\n\nDemo\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\n+1.919.864.2264\n\n\n\nJoin our Mailing List\n\nSign Up Here\n\n\n\n\n© 2024 Ndustrial  ·  Privacy  ·  Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        [contact-form-7 id=\"2147\" title=\"Modal Download\"]      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        [contact-form-7 id=\"2296\" title=\"Modal Download\"]      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManage Consent\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo provide the best experiences, we use technologies like cookies to store and/or access device information.
