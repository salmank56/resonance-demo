Also, they focus on reclaiming intermediate compounds to sell to commodities markets. Our Hydro-to-Cathode direct precursor synthesis process is more efficient and more sustainable while it returns higher-level materials to the supply chain. Using a life cycle assessment methodology from Argonne National Labs, our process demonstrated significant reductions in all environmental impact categories, when compared with traditional methods. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking sustainability pay off: Higher economic return encourages more EV battery recycling \n\n\n\nBy delivering engineered materials at lower cost, our Hydro-to-Cathode direct precursor synthesis process greatly improves the cost-effectiveness of battery recycling. Improved economics is the best way to boost battery recycling as the EV market grows, which will reduce the pressure to mine and process raw materials for critical battery applications. In this way, our closed-loop approach is a more direct path toward sustainable stewardship of our natural resources and supply chains, helping society to pursue carbon-neutral goals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCathode is the most expensive and carbon-intense material in batteries.
