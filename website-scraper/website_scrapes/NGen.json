NGen’s Future Ready project was launched to help manufacturers embrace the digital transformation and navigate labour shortages and skills gaps with practical solutions.\nFuture Ready consisted of: \n\nTransformation Leadership Program (TLP) & AmpUp Funding\nIn-Person Skilled Trades Events \nTools for manufacturers including NGen’s Skills Building Zone and NextSkillsAI \nBringing new workers into Canadian manufacturing: Wage Subsidies \nIndustry research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Ready French Video\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Ready Programs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransformation Leadership Program(TLP) & AmpUp Funding \n\nThe Transformation Leadership Program (TLP) and AmpUp Employee Training funding were built to address the skilled labour challenges in Canada’s manufacturing sector while helping manufacturers upskill existing workforces.\nTLP consisted of on demand and self paced modules and assessment tools which helped manufacturers identify strategic priorities and develop plans to overcome skills gaps. TLP manufacturers then had access to federal grants to use towards employee training programs of their choice. NGen facilitated access to these grants which cover 80% the cost of employees training programs, or up to $8,000 per company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn-Person Skilled Trades Events\n\n\n In-Person Skilled Trade Events provided newcomers to Canada with a chance to assess their readiness for the Canadian job market. \n Newcomers received a certificate proving they participated in a government recognized program, gained experience, made connections with instructors in their trade, and received video footage of their work—valuable assets they can use in future job application\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools for manufacturers including NGen’s Skills Building Zone and NextSkillsAI \n\n NGen’s industry-led research revealed that manufacturers needed new tools to help assess their core skills and build personalized plans for training and development. In response, NGen designed accessible, online tools and resources to support manufacturers in training their workforce.These included:\n\n Skills Building Zone: An online catalogue of on-demand training and tools for Canadian manufacturers and workers.\n Skills for Success Assessments – Know.Me.Q: NGen partnered with Me.Q to offer four individual assessments based on the Skills for Success framework to allow Canadian manufacturing workers to self-assess their core skills.​ These provide personalized recommendations for skills development.\n NextSkillsAI: An AI tool for manufacturers to reveal the competencies and skills gaps of their workforce and develop upskilling plans to address them. NextSkillsAI included insight into the impact of technology changes, digitalization, transition to net-zero carbon and other current challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing new workers into Canadian manufacturing: Wage Subsidies \n\nNGen partnered with Canadian Skills Training & Employment Coalition (CSTEC) to place new workers across 100+ manufacturing facilities, by facilitating manufacturer’s access to wage subsidies. In total, NGen distributed $3.447 million to manufacturers in wage subsidies. $7,000 was provided in support to members of equity-deserving and groups, and $5,000 was provided to all others.\n Impact: \n\n 606 individuals have been supported by wage subsidies to date. \n 70% of individuals are members of equity deserving groups.\n 92% of placements resulted in permanent employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada-wide Impact\nFuture Ready supported manufacturers from coast to coast, providing access to funding, tools, and programs to help overcome challenges in labour and skills shortages.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkilled trades events in:\n\nAlberta: 1\nSaskatchewan: 2\nOntario: 5\nPrince Edward Island: 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture Ready manufacturers by province:\n\nBritish Columbia: 46\nQuebec: 82\nAlberta: 26\nOntario: 191\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$900000+\ndelivered in upskilling training grants to manufacturers\n\n\n409\ncompanies registered for online modules and skills assessment\n\n\n375\nmanufacturing workers attended live TLP sessions\n\n\n700+\nindividuals participated in the TLP\n\n\n42\ntools released in both languages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndustry Research & Reports\nNGen collaborated with the Canadian Skills Training and Employment Coalition (CSTEC) to publish a series of industry reports investigating the impact caused by existing challenges in the manufacturing landscape:\n\n\nDecarbonization and its Impact on Canada's Manufacturing Workforce  \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\t  French\n\t\n\n\n\n\nDigitizing Canada s Advanced Manufacturing Sector: Reshaping Jobs and Skills  \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\t  French\n\t\n\n\n\n\nTechnological Innovation and Workforce Diversity in the Advanced Manufacturing Sector  \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\t  French\n\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Manufacturing Workforce: Trends and Opportunities \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\nAn Assessment of the Changing Skill Needs  of the Canadian Manufacturing Workforce  \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\t  French\n\t\n\n\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence in Manufacturing: The Evolution of Technology and Jobs in the Sector  \n\n\n\n            English\n          \n\n\n\n\t  French\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerri-Lynn is Future Ready\nTerri-Lynn's journey in the manufacturing industry is a testament to the impact of the Future Ready program is having on equity deserving communities.\nAs a LGBIQ+ single mother of three, she embarked on her new career at the age of 39, navigating through apprenticeships and overcoming workplace challenges, including those related to her identity and safety concerns during the pandemic.
