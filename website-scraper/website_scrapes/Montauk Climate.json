We will help build technologies that help manage that decarbonization demand.\n\n\n\nProviding Predictability & Relief\nA system more reliant on electricity, but with increasing power outages creates a significant near-term headwind to decarbonization. Our businesses seek to reduce that volatility so businesses and consumers can trust the decarbonization era.\n\n\n\nMetrics & Measurement\nMeasuring, managing, reducing and reporting carbon emissions has reached a tipping point of necessity and scale. Each of our businesses will contribute materially to the management of climate externalities for society. \n\n\n\nMobility\nMobility needs are changing rapidly in a future of electrification and autonomy.\n\n\n\nAdaptation\nIn the coming decades, capital flows or climate will strand assets suddenly. Our companies will help along adaptation by providing resilience planning, financial intermediation, and systems hardening.\n\n\n\nSustainability\nMany industries will revolutionize their business model for a circular and sustainable future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we invest in\n\n\n\n\n\n“Sustainability is history’s biggest investment opportunity.”\nAl Gore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Market Verticals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Enablement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkforce Development\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElectrification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPower Consistency & Quality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Equity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in buildingthe future with us?\n\nGet in Touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterested in buildingthe future with us?\n\nGet in Touch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninfo@montaukclimate.com\nMontauk Climate, L.L.C.
