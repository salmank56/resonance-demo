Unfortunately, rice cultivation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in agri-food and is responsible for up to 33% of Southeast Asia’s methane emissions.Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)AWD is simply the periodic drying and re-flooding of rice fields as opposed to keeping rice fields constantly flooded.\nIt’s proven to reduce water use by 30%, increase yield and cut down methane emissions by 1.4t per hectare per season.Direct Seeded Rice (DSR)The majority of SEA uses transplanted rice that are kept in constantly flooded nurseries.\nSowing rice seeds directly into the soil instead of using nurseries reduces water consumption, reduces seed cost and cuts down methane emission by 0.3t per hectare per season.Soil bacteria additiveThe addition of specialized bacteria tempers the soil.\nSoil bacteria additives reduce fertilizer use, improve grain quality and cut down methane emission by 3.3t per hectare per season.Our solutionOur solution incentivizes and rewards farmers to constantly adopt new practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase yields and elevate farmers’ well-being.Reduce water consumptionIncreased yieldImprove soil healthLet's make rice green againEnquiries: info@rize.farmPartnership: partnership@rize.farmBecome Investors: invest@rize.farmPrivacy policyCopyright 2023 © Rize PTE Ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbottom of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"https://www.rize.farm/press-releases": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPress Releases | Rize.Farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop of pageHomePress ReleasesContact UsCareersPress Releases4 minRize Raises US$14M in Series A Funding to Boost Tech Platform for Sustainable Rice FarmingMaking sustainable rice farming viable is essential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which account for more than 10% of global...4 minRize, TLL, and TLA Forge Strategic Partnership to Spearhead Sustainable Rice Cultivation in Indonesia[SINGAPORE, April 11 2024] Rize, a pioneering agritech startup dedicated to transforming rice cultivation through innovative and...Let's make rice green againEnquiries: info@rize.farmPartnership: partnership@rize.farmBecome Investors: invest@rize.farmPrivacy policyCopyright 2023 © Rize PTE Ltd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbottom of page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"https://www.rize.farm/support": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us | Rize.Farm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntop of pageHomePress ReleasesContact UsCareersHow can we help you today?Please fill out the form, and our experienced advisors will get in touch with you shortly.\n* indicates mandatory input fieldsEnquiriesinfo@rize.farmEmailpartnership@rize.farmBecome investorinvest@rize.farmFollow usFirst NameLast NameEmailMessageSendThanks for submitting!Our EntitiesRIZEAGTECH Private Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeWork Prestige Cube, Site No. 26, Laskar Hosur Road, Adugodi, Koramangala, BANGALORE, BENGALURU URBAN, KARNATAKA, 560030, India\n\n\n\n\n+91 9028938095PT Rize Farm Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n\nWisma 46 - KOTA BNI,Lantai 46-50, Jalan Jende Karet Tengsin, Tanah Abang, Kota Jakarta Pusat, Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta 10220, Indonesia\n\n\n\n\n+62 81517051213Rize Vietnam Company Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\nLim Tower 3 29A Nguyen Dinh Chieu, Da Kao Ward, District 1 Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 70000\n\n\n\n\nTBARize Pte.
