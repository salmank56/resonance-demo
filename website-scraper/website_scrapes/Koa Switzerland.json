Koa was born from a sophisticated concept, innovative processes, and a great deal of passion.\nAt Koa, we spot the hidden potential to empower people. We discovered that the cocoa fruit has much to offer besides the beans. The fruit lets us increase farmers’ income, create new jobs in rural areas and is a resource for added value for the people and planet.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n 100% transparent\nextra income\nfor small-scale farmers\nThrough training with Koa, cocoa farmers gain new knowledge and methods to process the previously discarded cocoa pulp. Thanks to the partnership with Koa, smallholder farmers earn an additional income which they receive on the same day as production. 100% of the payments are verified with blockchain.\n\n\nRadical Transparency\n\n\n\n \n\nBoosting\neconomic growth\nNEW JOBS IN RURAL GHANA\nMost of our team are young workers from the surrounding communities who now have a new outlook on life. Additionally, our team consists of internationally experienced experts, making valuable contributions towards sustainable growth in their home country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n40% less\nfood waste\nFOR A RESPONSIBLE USE\nOF RESOURCES\nBy processing the cocoa pulp, we make use of a natural resource, previously thrown away. Through solar power, we gently remove the surplus part of the fruit. The beans remain unharmed and proper fermentation of the beans for the chocolate production continues to be guaranteed.\nRENEWABLE ENERGY\nOur mobile processing equipment only runs on solar energy.

That’s why we call it a Community Mobile Processing Unit. In short, the CMPU is the core of the innovative process.\n\n\n\nINNOVATION\nThrough renewable energy, we can process cocoa fruits even in remote areas. Solar power also enables us to immediately cool the fresh cocoa fruit products to guarantee best quality. This is the first step of our production chain, in the heart of the tropical rainforest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThe Community Mobile Processing Unit (CMPU) allows us to process the cocoa fruits next to the cocoa farms.\n\nThe entire extraction process is powered by solar energy –\nfor a greener future.\n\nAll stages of the process are digitally monitored, from the first harvest and mobile processing, with the transport, and all the way to the packaged product. We can access the information at any time and from anywhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood quality within a\ndecentralised value chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROCESSING\nAfter the first processing step, the fresh cocoa fruit product is immediately brought to our factory in Assin Akrofuom for further processing. Within just three hours, the Koa products are pasteurised, packaged and ready to be shipped. For the best quality products, coming from the Ghanaian rainforest to the kitchens of the world.\n\n\n\nFOOD SAFETY\nWe put great emphasis on adhering to all hygiene regulations throughout the entire production process. This is why we do thorough quality checks at every stage and digital process monitoring in real-time. By doing so, we can ensure that our products meet the highest quality requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWorking with the CMPU, I grew very fond of our innovation. I’m proud to see the team being so ambitious to further optimise the processing unit. Needless to say, we want to increase the CMPU’s efficiency to work with even more farmers. In the end, the farmers are the centerpiece of our processes.\nSamuel Nkum Baah\nSenior Sourcing Manager\n\nAfter we’ve established the decentralised process, it’s all about ensuring food quality. In a tropical environment, it’s a major challenge we’re facing – but well possible.

In Ghana, the beans make up around 25% of the cocoa fruit. The pulp is another 25% and the rest is husk. The tasty pulp is often overlooked, which inspired us to upcycle it into tasty treats. By utilising cocoa fruit pulp through our innovative processes, this upcycling vision has become a reality – creating added value.\nA Fresh Taste\nThe fresh cocoa pulp balances tropical flavours of intense sweetness and exotic acidity. Thanks to gentle and swift processing, we preserve the natural taste of our products.\nCocoa Fruit Juice versus Cacao Fruit Juice: What’s the Difference?\nYou may have heard both terms before. Cacao fruit juice and cacao juice is generally the same as cocoa fruit juice. The same can be said about cacao fruit pulp and cocoa fruit pulp. We use the term ‘cocoa fruit’ because this is the preferred term in Ghana, where we operate and make an impact.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHear\nhow Koa\ntastes\nin Swiss German by\nRalf Wellauer, Max Felchlin AG\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout KoaImpact\nProduction\nProducts\nFind us\nTeam\nRadical Transparency\nKoa in Switzerland Koa Switzerland AG\nGiesshübelstrasse 40\n8045 Zurich, Switzerland\nhello@koa-impact.com\n\n\nInformationContact\nImprint & Policies\nPrivacy Policy\nJobs\nPress\nKoa in Ghana Koa Impact Ghana Ltd\nat SAL Heights\n52 Swaniker Street\nAbelemkpe, Accra\ninfo@koa-impact.com\n\n\n\nContacthello@koa-impact.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nNewsletter \n\n\n\n \n\n© 2024 Koa Switzerland AG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest a sample\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.Please enable JavaScript in your browser to complete this form.1Your data2Your sampleLayoutName *Email *Country *AfghanistanAlbaniaAlgeriaAndorraAngolaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBhutanBoliviaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBrazilBruneiBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCôte d'IvoireCabo VerdeCambodiaCameroonCanadaCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaColombiaComorosCongo (Congo-Brazzaville)Costa RicaCroatiaCubaCyprusCzechia (Czech Republic)Democratic Republic of the CongoDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (fmr. \"Swaziland\")EthiopiaFijiFinlandFranceGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGreeceGrenadaGuatemalaGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHoly SeeHondurasHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLaosLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMauritaniaMauritiusMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmar (formerly Burma)NamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNorth KoreaNorth Macedonia (formerly Macedonia)NorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine StatePanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPolandPortugalQatarRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited States of AmericaUruguayUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamYemenZambiaZimbabwePhoneCompany *Language *EnglishGermanFrenchSpanishSegmentIndustryGastronomyMediaStudentNextYour sample\nI am interested in receiving:Koa Pure(cocoa fruit juice)Koa Concentrate 72°(concentrated cocoa fruit juice)Koa Concentrate 50°(concentrated cocoa fruit juice)Koa Powder(dried cocoa fruit pulp)Koa Choco Powder(dried cocoa fruit pulp with cocoa powder)I am interested in receiving:Koa Pure(cocoa fruit juice)Koa Flakes(dried cocoa fruit pulp)Koa Choco Flakes(dried cocoa fruit pulp with cocoa powder)I am interested in receiving:Koa Pure(cocoa fruit juice)Koa Flakes(dried cocoa fruit pulp)I am interested in receiving:Koa NaturalAdditional comments or questions:Go backSubmit  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you like to resume your sample order?\nSure, of course!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"https://koa-impact.com/find-us/": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind us - Koa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou don't have javascript enabled.

The product gives me the confidence to do something good – for my guests as well as for the team of Koa in Ghana.\nSilvia Manser\nMichelin-starred chef\nRestaurant Truube in Gais, Switzerland\n\nKoa is something very fine, harmonic and balanced. It has a fruity sweetness and exotic acidity. The fresh juice is full-bodied with a silky smooth and clear texture. The aroma is reminiscent of lychee, peach, pear and rainforest honey.
