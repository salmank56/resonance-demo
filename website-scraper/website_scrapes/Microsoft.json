Office is now Microsoft 365, the premier productivity suite with innovative Office apps, intelligent cloud services, and world-class security. Office.com, the Office mobile app, and the Office app for Windows are now the Microsoft 365 app with a new icon, a new look, and even more features designed to help you achieve more.          Who will these changes apply to?        These changes will apply to everyone who uses the Office app for work, school, or personal use.           How will these changes impact me? Do I need to do anything?        There will be no impact to your existing account, profile, subscription, or files. The app will update automatically with a new icon and name in January 2023.          What is Microsoft 365?        Microsoft 365 is your powerful cloud-based productivity platform that include apps like Microsoft Teams, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive, as well as intelligent cloud services and advanced security. Get started with free web and mobile apps or upgrade to a premium plan for access to more apps, storage, and features.          What’s the relationship between Microsoft 365 and the Microsoft 365 app?        Use the Microsoft 365 app to access your favorite productivity tools, content, and apps, all in one place.          Where do I get the new Microsoft 365 app?        The Microsoft 365 app is available at Microsoft365.com, on Windows via the Microsoft Store, and in both Google Play and the Apple App Store.  For more premium apps and features, purchase a Microsoft 365 subscription.           Is internet access required for Microsoft 365?        Yes, internet access is required to install and activate Microsoft 365 and to get all the latest app releases and service updates. Note that if you are an existing subscriber, you do not need to reinstall or purchase another subscription. You do not need to be connected to the Internet to use apps such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, because the apps are fully installed on your computer.          Is Office going away entirely?        No. You will continue to get access to apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook as part of Microsoft 365. You will also be able to make a one-time purchase of those apps via Office 2021 and Office LTSC plans. Additionally, there are no changes to Office 365 subscription plans.
