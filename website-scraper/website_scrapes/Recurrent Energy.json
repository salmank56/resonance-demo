We actively filter for development opportunities that minimize or eliminate environmental and permitting issues and have strong, low-cost interconnection options. Significant development dollars are invested early in the process to thoroughly screen projects for potential fatal flaws that would impede a project’s successful completion.In addition to our development expertise, our success comes from a true commitment to community values. We recognize our projects have a long-term presence in the communities where they are sited, and we seek to foster a long-term community partnership to create a lasting, positive impact. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrigination & Structuring\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nOur origination & structuring capabilities are a key ingredient of our success. Recurrent Energy excels at using power market power trading tools and analytics to augment our projects’ development progress and align to our customers’ needs. We have a demonstrated history of structuring and customizing power contracts to serve our projects’ stakeholders, from our customers to our investors. To this end, we have executed contract structures from traditional, long-term, fixed-price power purchase agreements to more complex arrangements, such as short-term hedge agreements for individual power products (energy, capacity, and RECs). In every market, we look at adding energy storage to our solar projects to increase the flexibility and value of our power projects. Recurrent Energy has experience working with a variety of counterparties including investor-owned utilities, municipal utilities, community choice aggregators, retail energy providers, corporate and industrial customers, and educational institutions.We also offer build-own-transfer structures, where we complete development, finance, and build the project for the customer, ultimately transferring an operating project to the counterparty. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProject Finance\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nRecurrent Energy’s ability to secure capital to support its development pipeline is evidenced by the company’s past success in financing solar projects of formidable size and complexity. With billions of dollars of financings executed—spanning tax equity, sponsor equity, joint ventures, and debt—we have successfully structured sales and financing during all parts of the project life cycle including prior to and at NTP, mid-construction, COD, and during operation. Recurrent Energy has an extensive track record of hundreds of successful transactions and maintains strong relationships with leading banks and investors active in energy finance. These established relationships, coupled with Recurrent Energy’s focus on developing projects to meet the standards of top-tier financiers, allow us to secure capital on market leading terms.Recurrent Energy has experience executing a wide array of financing structures, and our in-house team arranges all parts of the capital structure. Such capabilities prove extremely valuable in a market with an increasing volume of non-traditional offtakes that require unique transaction structures. With the maturation of the solar and storage industries, the ability to harness power trading analysis, structured power products, and creative project finance is crucial to project success. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEngineering, Procurement & Construction\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nEquipment pricing for solar and battery storage projects fluctuates regularly, impacted by geopolitical considerations, raw materials constraints and technological improvements, among other factors. The dynamic nature of the equipment market, which largely drives the overall cost of a project, demonstrates the importance of savvy procurement to a project’s success. Expertise, relationship and capabilities are critical to ensure realistic cost assumptions, to avoid fatal flaws and appropriately price project energy output.Rather than sole-sourcing equipment supply, Recurrent Energy has a robust and diverse supply chain that ensures a broad selection of modules and batteries is available for the projects in the company’s portfolio. We deliver the highest level of project viability by eliminating sole-source risk and using bankable, low-risk technology. Additionally, as a subsidiary of Canadian Solar, Recurrent Energy has unique access to Canadian Solar’s leading module manufacturing capacity and battery storage integration capabilities.Recurrent Energy has self-performed EPC for its projects and for customers and has also employed EPC contractors.

Our deep experience and scale provides us with access to sign PPAs with top companies and arrange tax equity. \n\n\n\nAcross the world, Recurrent has a pipeline of 27 GWp in solar and 55 GWh in battery storage under development. As renewable energy grows exponentially and becomes a larger part of the resource mix, Recurrent has focused on providing solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon grid while also increasing grid reliability. \n\n\n\nEnergy storage provides a carbon-free alternative to traditional power capacity resources, with greater cost certainty and increased flexibility to access various value streams. Recurrent Energy leads the market in structuring and has executed one of the world’s first large-scale solar-plus-storage tolling agreements. We work closely with local communities, labor forces, and safe and reliable technology providers to develop and build solar and energy storage solutions.
